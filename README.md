Deployed site using Netlify: https://66be293690a2175f7d28cd30--bright-longma-7808a3.netlify.app/

The goal of this app was to build a simple weather app that a user can input a city and get current information about the city such as a weather, temperature, and a description displayed to them. I also tried to implement creating links to other cites close to the searched city that a user can click. A problem that I ran into was a 401 error with the API call that I couldn't figure out how to fix, so unfortunately I was not able to get any weather data.

The approach I took and some of the technologies I used were React and JSX to make it easier to write the project in components. I also used Axios to use to make get requests, and error handling for the API. I created a component for the navbar and a pages for the city weather data.

I'm not very proud that it doesn't work, but thank you for taking a look at my project!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
